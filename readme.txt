Protecting your website against copyright infringement and plagiarism.

== Description ==
This Copyfight plugin has been optimized for WordPress and includes a (dashboard) widget, shortcode, post and page options to keep your content protected against infringement and plagiarism. It also protects you against spam bots and data breaches.

Copyfight distinguish itself not relying on JavaScript. That’s not such a surprise in itself, but what is a surprise is the step forward this protection represents, not just in one area but several. Those who thought Anti-plagiarism had had its day may have to think again. While the applications are impressive in themselves, the ability to protect textual content is both a major technological advance and a major selling point.

Besides the groundbreaking protection technique it keeps spammers from harvesting email addresses. Enterprises are using the Copyfight API to prevent scraping their content. This ensures their data from their own API will be used instead of data from their sites. Now WordPress users can use this great service too.

In WordPress the title, excerpt and tags are kept untouched. Only the body of a post or page is protected. Which can be enabled or disabled per article. Shortcode notations are also kept untouched. Within the body text it is possible to unprotect text by using [square brackets] or by using the special shortcode. This can be useful for search engine optimization although Copyfight automatically tags the post or page with the most important keywords.
